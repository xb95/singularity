* BROKER SYSTEM?

A very large component is brokers to enable us to talk to nodes without
having to connect directly to them, and subscribe to updates.

* Broker implementation, which is a sub-module of the agent. Some agents
  are brokers, some aren't. But they run in a separate goroutine so it
  is logically separate from our functionality.

* TAGS (roles, etc)

We need a way to select machines without having to select by name. Doing
it by some sort of tag system (key=value) would enable us to add roles,
etc. Plus, being able to select by facter.

* ALERTS/MESSAGES

Command line tools for sending alerts/messages back and forth and
subscribing?

* SUBSYSTEMS

I want to be able to implement something like Angel. I don't want this
to be in the core though. Someone can write something, in whatever
language, maybe with a ZMQ specific protocol? Or too much overhead?

 - You register yourself as a subsystem.

 - You can use the Singularity core for passing messages and data.

* OTHER NOTES

Read RFC 5735 and create a function that auto-binds to any assigned IPs
that fall inside appropriate ranges. I.e., we should bind on IPs that
are in the loopback range and private network ranges, but NOT on any
interfaces that are publicly routable or unroutable. (Unless someone
gives us a command line option to force a bind.)
