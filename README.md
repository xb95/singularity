singularity
===========

This is, maybe, eventually, ideally, going to be a tool to make my
life as a sysadmin/developer/whatever a lot easier. I have this in a
repository on GitHub right now to give me time to work on it between
machines, and I guess interested people can poke at it.

For now, this is not yet in any sort of documented, publicly consumable
state. Hang tight!
