# This is a YAML file that describes something that the Singularity system
# is supposed to keep track of.
#
# The way to think about this is that you tell Singularity that you want
# something to happen if certain conditions are met. It keeps track of the
# conditions and then, if they are met, does something.

# You can define templates which allow you to apply a set of parameters to
# something else, later.

# There are two main types of things -- jobs and triggers. A job is something
# that is expected to be long running. Triggers are also programs, but they
# should run quickly and perhaps frequently.

# If you want to create things like "trigger when RAM is under 500MB free"
# then you should probably use a plugin. In essence, a plugin is something
# that the agent runs for you, and the plugin can send commands.

# The above plugin, for example, watches RAM usage. When certain thresholds are
# hit, it sends commands like 'event LowRam' or something.
#
# Then you can do:

        # Don't run more often than this.
